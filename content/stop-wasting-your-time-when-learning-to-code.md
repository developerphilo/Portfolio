Software development is an ever-changing field with every coming day. The only way to become relevant in the job market is to keep learning now and again. New technologies crop in every time and learning is the best way to become relevant in this ever-changing space.
While learning and adopting new technologies at the same time may be difficult. In some instances, you may be quite as well wasting a lot of time when learning things.
This piece is for you if you always find it difficult to learn a new technology or skill. In this piece, you are going to learn some methods that you can use to improve your learning process and stop wasting a lot of time.

**1. Focus on one thing at a time**

There are always a bunch of things to be leant very moment in time. Trying to learn two or more things at a time is unproductive and most of the time will see you waste a lot of time learning. On the contrary, try and pick up one technology to learn at a time.
This will take you up to speed in unravelling the basics of that given technology. On the same note, it will enable you to divert your focus onto one thing which is very relevant in your learning process.

**2. Pick a roadmap**

Now you have picked a technology or skill that you want to learn, whatâ€™s next? Trying to learn things randomly is a bad and unproductive habit. On the contrary, try and break down the subject matter into small subtopics.
This is essential in separating concerns in a small and digestible manner. Check the overall way in which the given technology or skill is structured and try and break it down into small topics or subtopics.
The roadmap will also act as a guide on what you are to learn next and in what manner. Other than that, the roadmap will also provide a clear insight into which skills and resources you need to reach your targeted goal.
According to [Brian de Haaff](https://twitter.com/bdehaaff), a roadmap is necessary to ensure that:

- It drives self-awareness.
- It provides a framework for success and a true north to keep working towards.
- It makes it easier to ask for assistance from others on your journey.

**3. Build projects**

Learning is only as good as building projects. Building projects is what introduces you to the core thinking behind given technology. When you build, you are challenged to think outside the box and implement what you have leant.
Building projects also offer a better understanding of whether you have learnt the basics of the given technology or skill. Not only does it test your general basic understanding but also introduces you to various means and ways to solve problems like a software developer.
If you want to learn faster and stop wasting time, build as many projects as you can with the given technology.

**4. Avoid memorizing stuff**

Programming and in this aspect software development is all about solving problems through code. Memorizing ways to solve problems is not a good idea to partake as a software developer.
Most if not all the time; you will be presented with various problems. Trying to brute force and solve problems with memorized solutions will most of the time not work. On the contrary, try and understand how the given technology works behind the scenes instead of memorizing its syntax.

**Conclusion**

Just to recap some of the ways we have seen in learning things fast and not wasting a lot of time:

- Focus on one thing at a time
- Pick a roadmap
- Build projects
- Avoid memorizing stuff

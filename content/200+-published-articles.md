**1.	Structure your articles (line breaks, white spaces, images, etc.)**


Structuring your articles makes it easier for people to read and go through them. Make use of paragraph breaks and use of white spaces. 
You don't want to write articles that your audience finds challenging to read.


**2.	Make use of outlines**

Outlines guide you on what you need to write and how to structure your piece; doing this saves you a lot of time when you have none.


**3.	Write down your random article ideas**

Have a notebook/online space where you write down ideas immediately when they hit you. It helps you not to forget ideas.

**4.	Edit, edit, edit and publish**

Edit your pieces before you publish them. You also give the editors better experience editing your articles, and they can't wait to see your next piece. 

You also want to give your audience a better flow without random grammatical and spelling errors.

**5.	Niche down to what you know/what you want to know and learn**

When you niche down to what you know, it is easier to get ideas about what you can write. You can go overboard and start writing about what you want to know or learn.

**6.	Forget about looking at your stats**

Looking over your stats will overcrowd your mind and distract you from your writing. Stats are not always a replica of your quality and style of writing.

**7.	Write as many craps as you can**

Starting out writing, I always felt bad about my writing. As time went by, my writing gradually started to improve with every piece that I wrote.

According to @nicolascole, "In the game of Online Writing, volume wins.”

**8.	Don’t worry about your quality**

Stressing over your writing quality is not similar to taking yourself for a trial. write as many pieces as you can, and with time, your quality will scale up gradually.

**9.	Incorporate your style into your writing**

There are a lot of similar articles out there on various problems, but what makes one stand out from the other?
While writing, try and weave your unique style into your writing.

**10.	Be straightforward in your writing**

Avoid using big words and technical jargon in your writing. You will bore up the reader in no time.
Use direct and straightforward language to the reader. Writing is more like talking to the reader and sharing your thoughts with them. Good writing is concise and clear.

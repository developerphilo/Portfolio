Code review is a crucial part of every software development process. It involves having one or more team members review the code written by another team member to ensure that it is of high quality, follows coding standards, and is free of bugs.
Having had several code review in almost every Pull Request I made, here are some of the benefits of having code reviews.

## Improved codeÂ quality

Code review helps ensure that code is of high quality and meets the necessary development standards. Performing code reviews allows team members to catch any mistakes or issues that may have been missed during the initial writing of the code. This can help prevent costly bugs and improve the overall quality of the software.

For instance, a code reviewer may spot an issue in the code pattern that could cause malfunctions in production. By catching this issue's earlier on, the team can avoid a potentially serious bug in the final product. In addition, code review provides an opportunity for team members to share their knowledge and expertise.

This can help improve the quality of the code by ensuring that it is written in the most efficient and effective way possible. Take for instance, a more experienced team member may be able to suggest a better algorithm for solving a particular problem, or suggest a more elegant solution to a coding challenge. By incorporating this knowledge into the code, the team can produce software that is of the highest quality.

## Improves collaboration

Code review is not just about catching bugs and improving code quality. It is also a great way to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing within a team. When developers review each other's code, they have an opportunity to learn from one another and share best practices. This can help improve the overall skill level of the team and make it easier for new team members to get up to speed quickly.

Code reviews provides opportunity for team members to collaborate and share their knowledge and expertise. This encourages open communication and can help to foster a collaborative environment where team members can learn from each other and provide constructive feedback.

## Early detection of bugs/catching missed edge casesÂ earlier

Code review allows team members to catch bugs early on in the development process. By having several pair of eyes on review, the team can catch several edges cases that was missed when writing the code implementation.

This helps save a lot of time and effort that would otherwise be spent fixing bugs later on. It also helps prevent the release of software with major bugs, which can be detrimental to the reputation of the company. Code review can help to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code, which can be addressed before the code is deployed to production. This can help to protect the codebase and the end users. This can help improve the general security posture of the product and company as a whole.

## Improves code readability

Code review can help improve the readability of the code. This is important because it makes it easier for other team members to understand and work with the code. It also makes it easier for future team members to pick up where previous developers left off.

By having multiple developers review code, it is more likely that the code will adhere to the team's coding standards and conventions. This can help to ensure that the code is consistent and easy to read and maintain. This can be particularly helpful in future, or for new team members contributing to the project.

## Improves team cohesion/morale

Code review can help improve team morale by providing a supportive environment where developers can share their ideas and receive feedback. It can also help reduce the boredom and pressure that often comes with software development by allowing team members to collaborate and catch mistakes early on.

While coding alone in a room can feel like working in a silo, collaborating with other team members makes work feel like a collective task.

## Final thoughts

In conclusion, having code review is an essential part of the software development process. It provides numerous benefits, such as improved code quality, increased collaboration, early detection of bugs, increased code readability, enhance security, and improved team morale.

Implementing a code review process can help ensure the success of a software project and the satisfaction of the team members involved. Code reviews helps a lot.

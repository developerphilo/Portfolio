Hi a little introduction about myself.

I am John Philip, a software developer and technical writer. I have been working on freelance and contract roles for some time now and it is a big privilege that I will be joining Capsule Social full time.
Check out the initial tweet from the co-founder Nadim Kobeissi.

I’ll be joining the incredible team at Capsule Social to help build the future of decentralized social media platform.

Capsule Social’s main aim is to build a decentralised social media platform that just works. This means the platform will offer a social media network without biasness and content that is resistant to takedowns and individual censorship. 

The project started from a tweet that has seen many people attract the idea.
Being trusted with such a task mean a lot to me and I will provide my best to ensure the success of this project. 

Watch this video to get an in-depth view about Capsule Social.

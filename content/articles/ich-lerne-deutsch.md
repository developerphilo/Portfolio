Have you wondered why the title and subtitle of this article are in German? Well, I'm learning German! I have always wanted to learn a third language, and some of the languages that interested me were Japanese, Greek, Dutch, Deutsch, and French.

Earlier the start of February, I contacted a school offering study programs for foreign languages and got enrolled. Unfortunately, among the languages I wanted to learn, most were not offered at the school except German. So I decided to give learn German. The qualifications needed to start the program were a high school certificate, an identification number (ID), and the required fees for the first semester.

The Deutsch study program is expected to last a period of six (6) months with the program being divided into four major parts i.e: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening. During the first week, we focused on learning the basics of most languages such as alphabet letters, numbers, greetings, and farewells. Do you know the German language has four additional alphabetical letters compared to the most common 26 letters. These letters are umlauts (ä,ö,ü) and eszet (ß).

I have found that learning a new language is closely similar to learning a new programming languages, frameworks, or new technology. The basics are more important as you learn and delve into more advanced concepts. It's a new challenge for me, but I'm motivated to cover most of the coursework while still working on the side.

Another noticeable trait of Deutsch is the difference in pronunciation between masculine and feminine words, such as Mein and Meine which refers to masculine and feminine words respectively. Although it's still a new language to me, I'm excited to continue learning and interacting in Deutsch soon.

At the moment, Duolingo is my out-of-class learning partner, and I plan to maintain my streak until my final examination. If you're considering learning a new language, I highly recommend it.

Until next time, auf Wiedersehen!

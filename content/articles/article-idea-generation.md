**How to Generate Article Ideas for Technical Writing**

**My approach for generating article ideas**

Maintaining consistency while writing is a great skill many people would want to have and hone. While this might not always come easy especially when you have little to no article ideas.

Over the past six months, I have found a better serving way to get article ideas and keep writing consistently.

Writing has improved the way I interact with people through words and my general thought process. on the same note, writing has inclined my life and brought me different opportunities.

In this article, I am going to share my approach to generating article ideas every day.

**New things I have learnt**

Documenting new things I have learnt always has proved handy in generating article ideas. I try to break it down into things that I can refer to and learn how I did them earlier. This kind of article I like to structure them into "how to" articles.

For instance, when I learn let’s say about conditional rendering in Vue.js, I would write an article on “conditional rendering in Vue.js”.

this is one of the ways I get ideas for my article and it is very effective for everyone.

**Projects I am building**

This approach I implement after building some projects or particular features in a given project. This is a good way of documenting new features into your projects or portfolio and can help other two who would want to implement such features.

A clear example of this was when I was building and incorporating a blog section into my portfolio website. Being a Vue.js enthusiast I implemented NuxtJS content which offers some great and powerful capabilities.

I wrote all about the process and how I build it from scratch and implemented the working blog. This is another idea generation that has proved helpful in the long run.

**Errors/problems I have resolved**

This is also another area that I have found helpful in article idea generation. Bugs and errors always are there now and again.

Finding solutions to such errors and bugs is always a daunting task.
Whenever I find a solution to a particular problem, I tend to write down my go around solution to the given problem.

This can also be a great way to help out others who might be stuck with the same problem in the future.

This idea generation method has also proved very helpful especially with the fact that we software developers face and find a lot of bugs and issues every now and gain.

**My opinions on various things**

Writing down my thought and opinion on a given topic has also proved to be very helpful in the long run. This may be from the way I perceive a given technology to some processes I have found that have worked for me and others that haven't worked out.

This has proved to be great in getting to know other people’s opinions on various topics and what they have learnt along the way.

**Before you go**

My article idea generation with the following methods has proved to be very handy in getting what to write about. These methods have fed me daily writing ideas for the past six months and counting.

You can try and implement these on your own and see the crazy number of ideas you can write about.
